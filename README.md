Website UI designed with pure html/css

I started this project to build out the website UI using pure html and css without the elp of js and css frameworks. 

The process turned out to be extremely time consuming and I have decided to continue this in a different repository that will utilize frameworks (mainly bootstrap).

The project accomplished in it's task to help me understand the resource constrained and bare metal styling and structure building.
